/**
 * A container view that can display a stream of [BackStackScreen] instances.
 *
 * This container supports saving and restoring the view state of each of its subviews corresponding
 * to the renderings in its [BackStackScreen]. It supports two distinct state mechanisms:
 *  1. Classic view hierarchy state ([View.onSaveInstanceState]/[View.onRestoreInstanceState])
 *  2. AndroidX [SavedStateRegistry] via [ViewTreeSavedStateRegistryOwner].
 *
 * ## A note about `SavedStateRegistry` support.
 *
 * The [SavedStateRegistry] API involves defining string keys to associate with state bundles. These
 * keys must be unique relative to the instance of the registry they are saved in. To support this
 * requirement, [BackStackContainer] tries to generate a best-effort unique key by combining its
 * fully-qualified class name with both its [view ID][View.getId] and the
 * [compatibility key][com.squareup.workflow1.ui.Compatible.compatibilityKey] of its rendering.
 *
 * This method isn't guaranteed to give a unique registry key, but it should be good enough: If you
 * need to nest multiple [BackStackContainer]s under the same `SavedStateRegistry`, just wrap each
 * [BackStackScreen] with a [NamedScreen], or give each [BackStackContainer] a unique view ID. If that
 * heuristic fails you, use [ViewEnvironment.withBackStackStateKeyPrefix] to add unique names to
 * the [ViewEnvironment] used to show each [BackStackScreen].
 *
 * There's a potential issue here where if our ID is changed to something else, then another
 * [BackStackContainer] is added with our old ID, that container will overwrite our state. Since
 * they'd both be using the same key, [SavedStateRegistry] would throw an exception. As long as this
 * container is detached before its ID is changed, it shouldn't be a problem.
