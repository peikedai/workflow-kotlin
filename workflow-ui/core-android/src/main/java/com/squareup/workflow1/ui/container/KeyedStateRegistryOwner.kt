 * [ViewTreeSavedStateRegistryOwner.get] on itself, one of these is returned.
 *
 * Internally, this class exposes a [controller] to allow the [ViewStateCache] to save and restore
 * any state registered by child views.
 *
 * To create an instance, call [installAsSavedStateRegistryOwnerOn].
 *
 * @param key The key used to save and restore this controller from a [SavedStateRegistry].
 * @param lifecycleOwner The [LifecycleOwner] that will be delegated to by this instance. Note that
 * [SavedStateRegistryOwner] extends [LifecycleOwner].
